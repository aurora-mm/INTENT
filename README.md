The INTENT compilation series provides a platform for electronic and experimental music artists to share their work and set goals for the coming year, encouraging and inspiring creativity, innovation, and artistic vision from all corners of the globe. Since its launch in 2019, INTENT has become a powerful resource for artists aiming to realize their ambitions and monitor their progress over time. We are proud to continue providing INTENT as a compilation that goes beyond the ordinary, providing a truly transformative and ever-evolving experience.

In conjunction with the project, two tools were created: [SForm](https://github.com/linfri/INTENT/tree/main/SForm), a submission form application written in R (Shiny), and [INTIS](https://github.com/linfri/INTENT/tree/main/INTIS) (INTENT Insights), a dashboard illustrating the global outreach of the project.
