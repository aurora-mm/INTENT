# INTENT

The INTENT compilation series provides a platform for electronic and experimental music artists to share their work and set goals for the coming year, encouraging and inspiring creativity, innovation, and artistic vision from all corners of the globe. Since its launch in 2019, INTENT has become a powerful resource for artists aiming to realize their ambitions and monitor their progress over time. We are proud to continue providing INTENT as a compilation that goes beyond the ordinary, providing a truly transformative and ever-evolving experience.

## Roadmap

This repository is, mildly said, a work in progress. The previous volumes of INTENT (2020-2022) are to be reissued via Default Standard Records (Greece), the 2023 iteration will include six "traditional" volumes released via Mahorka (Bulgaria), and three "sister" projects: "Absichten", "Itapli Ti Bia-Etea" and "uni.Sol_stice". INTIS (INTENT Insights) will be updated and moved to this repo, and materials pertaining to the INTENT survey will be available here, as well as the history of the project.
