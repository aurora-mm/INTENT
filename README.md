Once upon a time, we believed that our lives were predetermined and that we had little control over our destiny. But, as we've grown and learned, we've come to understand that setting intentions can truly change the trajectory of our lives. It's a powerful idea that has transformed many lives, and it's something we still believe in today. This project, spanning four years and featuring numerous contributions from artists all around the world, is a testament to the power of intention. It's a reminder that we can all create the life we want if we're willing to put in the work and stay committed to our goals. And with the right attitude, commitment and resilience, anything is possible.

With 314 contributions from 127 artists representing 36 countries and spanning seven labels between 2020 and 2023, this project was truly global in scope. Detailed statistics are available in the [INTIS](https://github.com/linfri/INTENT/tree/main/INTIS) (INTENT Insights) dashboard, providing a comprehensive picture of the project's reach and impact. The full story behind the project, as well as its complete archive, can be found in the [Data Echoes](https://github.com/linfri/data-echoes) database, providing a window into the creative process and the collaborative effort that made this project a reality.

Looking to the future, we are filled with hope and excitement for what lies ahead. The lessons we learned and the skills we honed during this project will serve us well in many aspects of our lives. We are stronger, more resilient, and more creative than ever before. And we know that whatever may come our way, we have the power to overcome it and thrive. Let us continue to push the boundaries of what is possible and inspire others to do the same. The world needs our resilience and adaptability now more than ever, and we are ready to rise to the challenge.
